Lauck , from Lincoln , Nebraska , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred .	B-PER O O B-LOC O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" The struggle will go on , " the 43-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O
Lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O
The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism .	O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O
Lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 1970s .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O B-LOC O O O O
" Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than 20 years , " presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court .	O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O
" He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany . "	O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O
said Bertram , who also read out extracts from Lauck 's material praising Hitler as " the greatest of all leaders " and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth .	O B-PER O O O O O O O B-PER O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O B-MISC O O O O

He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck 's defence team had argued that U.S freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books , magazines , videos and flags in his homeland .	O O O B-MISC O O O O B-LOC O B-PER O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

" It is high time he was behind bars , " the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC O O O O O
Lauck , dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache , showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But as Lauck was about to be led away , he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court .	O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Neither the National Socialists ( Nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen , " he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark . "	O O O B-MISC I-MISC O B-MISC O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O B-LOC O O
That 's the truth . "	O O O O O O

Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers ' Party Foreign Organisation ( NSDAP-AO ) , which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler 's Nazi party .	B-PER O B-PER O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O B-PER O B-MISC O O
During the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO 's " NS Kampfruf " ( " National Socialist Battle Cry " ) magazine , filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O B-MISC O
The court rejected Sieg 's argument that Lauck 's extradition from Denmark , where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities , was illegal .	O O O B-PER O O O B-PER O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O
Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
He will probably be free in around two and a half years .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals , with nothing imported in return .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O
She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year , or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion , she said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O
" The cost of exported goods is too often understated , so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher , " Volkova said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O

In line with the decree , which will come into force on November 1 , all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" If traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , " Volkova said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O
Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but Volkova said the authorities are currently " tackling the technicalities of the issue " .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade , but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus .	O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A few years ago , barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of Russian exports because " thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems " , Volkova said .

Lewis , making a rare appearance in Europe in a sprint race , left the track with a slight limp .	B-PER O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O
American Olympic high hurdles champion Allen Johnson defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 12.92 seconds in the 110 metres race , just 0.01 outside the world record held by Britain 's Colin Jackson .

A year after its massively publicized introduction , Microsoft Corp. 's Windows 95 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry .	O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O B-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even though more than 40 million copies of Windows 95 have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 , 1995 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers .

" It did n't do as well as it could have , " said Rob Enderle , an analyst with Giga Information Group .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , " said Scott Winkler , an analyst with Gartner Group .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O

Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 95 , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said Ann Stephens , president of PC Data Inc .

To be sure , sales of Windows 95 and the accompanying Office 95 upgrade drove Microsoft sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company .

Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of Windows 95 will surpass that of the older version of Windows , now used on about 100 million computers worldwide .

He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks .

" Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer , " Winkler said . "	O B-ORG O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O
Many people began to believe that Windows 95 was being downplayed . "	O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC O O O O O
But now that Windows NT 4.0 has been launched , Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows 95 .

" Windows 95 is going to do great , " he said . "	O B-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O

China copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade .	B-LOC O O O O O O O O O

HONG KONG 1996-08-23	B-LOC I-LOC O
Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday .	O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O
Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG O O O O O O
It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O
Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But one source , the head of a Hong Kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not .	O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou , it will be sitting there for years , " he said .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Once it arrives in Yingkou , it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , " he said .	O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it .	O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG O O
A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously .	B-ORG O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year .	O O B-LOC O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs .	O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market .	O O B-ORG O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics ( BME ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes , " whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental " in an already tight world market .	O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp , with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals .	B-ORG O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O B-ORG O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement .	B-ORG O B-ORG O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O

They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases .	O O O O O O O O O O
They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But these concerns were irrelevant , a Singapore trader said , despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year .	O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O
As with many commodities , " there is a desire ( by the Chinese government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal , " he said . "	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam faltered in their second league match of the season on Saturday losing 2-0 away at Heerenveen .	B-MISC O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O
Ajax , who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating NAC of Breda in their opening game , had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock .	B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eight minutes after the interval , Heerenveen 's Romeo Wouden broke through the Amsterdam defence , left defender John Veldman standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar into the Ajax net .

Ajax , without injured defenders Marcio Santos and Winston Bogarde and strikers Jari Litmanen and Marc Overmars , then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise .	B-ORG O O O O B-PER I-PER O B-PER I-PER O O B-PER I-PER O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O

President Bill Clinton has served notice he intends to be busy " making news " -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year .	O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With Democrats gathering in Chicago to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president , Clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival Bob Dole .

" Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , " Clinton said . "	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O
That plan has now reached my desk . "	O O O O O O O O O
" Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , " he said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Actually , creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger .	O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O

It is an example of Clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 5 presidential election .	O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Although officials decline to say just what each day 's " news " will be , the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
Each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Campaign officials then hope the day 's " news " event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

One feature of the Java language is that small software programmes , known as " applets " because they are small applications , can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use .

In this model , individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time , also saving costs of memory and storage .

Takeda , 18 , showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian Ducati rider Troy Corser , last year 's championship runner-up , with four of the 25 laps left .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC B-ORG O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

But Takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with Haga second and Yoshikawa third .	O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O B-PER O O
Haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 147.159 kph .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
Corser , who crashed during practice on Friday , limped in fourth , four seconds behind Takeda with championship leader Aaron Slight of New Zealand 11 seconds behind the winner .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O B-PER I-PER O B-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O
In the second race , Takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner Takuma Aoki .	O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O
Aoki , the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion Haruchika , had a race-long duel with John Kocinski of the United States on a Ducati before taking the chequered flag .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O B-LOC I-LOC O O B-ORG O O O O O O

Haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of Slight with Corser in 10th place .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O B-PER O B-PER O O O O
But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with Slight still leading on 280 points , followed by Corser with 269 and Kocinski with 254 .	O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O B-PER O O O
